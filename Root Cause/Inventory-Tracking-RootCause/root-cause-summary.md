# Root Cause Summary

**Root Cause:**  
No centralized or automated inventory tracking system exists for product transfers. As a result, the process depends on manual counts and verbal/hardcopy communication between the head office and annex. This causes discrepancies, untraceable mismatches, and inefficiencies.
