### 1. Manual Processes = Human Error
Relying on verbal or handwritten notes—even with good intentions—leads to inconsistencies. Manual tracking has no safeguards.

✅ **Lesson:** Standardization and automation eliminate costly guesswork.

### 2. No Central Source of Truth = Finger-Pointing
When both locations work in silos, each blames the other for mismatches. Without shared systems, there’s no objective proof.

✅ **Lesson:** Shared records and visibility improve accountability.

### 3. You Can’t Improve What You Don’t Track
Without accurate data, it’s impossible to diagnose recurring issues, measure improvements, or validate performance.

✅ **Lesson:** Data-driven processes enable meaningful analysis and continuous improvement.
