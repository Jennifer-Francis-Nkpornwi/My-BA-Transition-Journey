## 📌 Requirement Gathering

This folder contains Business Analysis artifacts focused on the Requirements Gathering phase, including:

- 📄 Business Requirements Documents (BRDs)
- 🧩 Use Cases
- 🗣️ Elicitation Techniques & Samples (e.g., stakeholder workshops, prototyping)

These documents showcase hands-on learning and application of key BA skills like stakeholder engagement, requirement documentation, and solution discovery — all part of my transition into Business Analysis.
