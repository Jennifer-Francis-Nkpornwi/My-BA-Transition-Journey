# 👋 Hi, I'm Jennifer Francis-Nkpornwi – Transitioning into Business Analysis 🚀

After over 5 years in Customer Service and Sales Administration roles, I recently stepped into a Sales Representative/Manager position — a journey that’s helped me discover something deeper: **my passion for systems, strategy, and solving business problems**. This realization sparked my transition into Business Analysis, where I feel truly at home.

## 🛠️ My Background: Where BA Skills Started Showing Up

In my previous roles, I found myself doing more than just managing sales and supporting clients. I was:

- Using data to identify trends and patterns in customer behavior  
- Solving problems with a mix of critical thinking and creativity  
- Communicating insights with both sales teams and senior management  
- Managing stakeholder relationships across departments  
- Leading mini-projects, especially around reporting and internal process improvements  

Without even realizing it, I was practicing core BA skills — and **loving it**.

## 💡 The Lightbulb Moment

My “aha” moment came when my company decided to reorganize the customer service department. I was asked to lead the collaboration with the BA and PM team, providing key information they needed for the transition.

That experience **lit a fire in me** — I saw myself on the other side of that table, doing the actual analysis, solving business problems, and improving systems.  
That’s when I knew: **this is what I’m meant to do**.

## 🚀 My Transition into Business Analysis

To prepare, I enrolled in **Tritek Academy**, where I worked on real-world BA and PM artifacts with a team — creating documents like:

- Business Requirements Documents (BRDs)  
- High-Level Requirements (HLRs)  
- Use Case Diagrams  
- Wireframes  
- Test Cases  
- Business Process Maps  

I’m currently **deepening my knowledge through self-learning**, practicing with tools, and building a portfolio of sample projects right here on GitHub.  
Each project helps me master tools, practice documentation, and tell the story of my BA journey.

## 🔍 What I Love About Business Analysis

The parts of BA work that excite me most include:

- **Data-driven analysis**: finding the story behind the numbers  
- **Process optimization**: spotting inefficiencies and making things better  
- **Systems thinking**: imagining how all the parts of a business fit together and how to improve them  

I'm open to working in any industry where I can grow, contribute meaningfully, and bring value through analysis and collaboration.

## 📈 What I’m Working On Now

- Building my Business Analysis portfolio  
- Studying BA tools and methods  
- Learning how to network and connect with other BAs — especially right here on LinkedIn

## 🤝 Let’s Connect

If you’re a fellow BA, a mentor, or a hiring manager, I’d love to connect, learn from you, and maybe collaborate.
