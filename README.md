# 💼 My BA Transition Journey — April to August 2025

Welcome to my Business Analysis Portfolio! 👋  

I’m Jennifer Francis-Nkpornwi — a Sales Personnel and Data Enthusiast transitioning into Business Analysis.

Over the past few months, I’ve been building my skills through team-based, hands-on projects and study activities. I’ve worked on a real-world mock projects and collaborated with fellow beginners to deepen my understanding of business analysis tools and techniques.

Now, I’m undergoing a personal journey to **relearn, practice, and truly own** the core concepts of Business Analysis. This portfolio will showcase my progress through **structured weekly tasks**, **project artifacts**, and **documented learnings** — all aligned with my study plan from April to August 2025.

## ✨ About This Portfolio

As I grow in the Business Analysis field, this space will become a home for:

- 📂 BA artifacts like stakeholder maps, use cases, and user stories  
- ✍️ Reflections on what I’m learning and practicing

I hope it inspires others on their journey — and gives insight into my capabilities, progress, and growth mindset.
