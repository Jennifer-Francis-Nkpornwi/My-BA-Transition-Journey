# Inventory Movement Process Flow

## 📌 Context

This process flow diagram represents the current workflow for transferring products from the head office to the annex.

The goal was to visualize the process to identify where inventory mismatches and communication breakdowns may occur.

## 🧭 Flow Overview

- Products packed & counted at Head Office  
- Shipped with the counted values via verbal/handwritten waybill  
- Received & counted separately at Annex  
- Annex Records separately and cross check against the document that was sent by Head office
- Annex Alerts the head office of any discrepancy noted
- the products are then stocked in the annex warehouse
